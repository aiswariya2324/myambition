<p>my favourite subject is computer and maths because I have always been curious about new technologies and mathematical operations, How the applications run,how games are created,how tricks of cases are solved . Now that I have started to learn about coding I find it interesting and very simple to do. I look forward to creating many applications and games and use my math intelligence to help me with coding .
